# 🚀 Building My Portfolio Website  

## 🌐 Web Development Project  

This repository showcases my personal portfolio website, designed to present my current and future projects in a professional manner.  

It contains two versions of my portfolio:  

1. **Custom Portfolio Website** (`Jane's Website/`)  
   - Built from scratch using modern web development techniques.  
   - Implements responsive design for seamless viewing on all devices.  
   - Follows best practices for HTML, CSS, and accessibility.  

2. **Omnifood Project** (`Omnifood/`)  
   - A guided project developed as part of my HTML and CSS learning journey.  
   - Based on the **Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS** course on Udemy.  
   - Covers key front-end concepts such as flexbox, grid, and animations.  

These projects have helped me gain hands-on experience in front-end web development, including layout structuring, styling, and user experience design.
