# 🚀 Building My Portfolio Website  

## 🌐 Web Development Project  

I created my personal portfolio website to showcase my current and future projects in a structured and visually appealing way. This repository contains two versions of my portfolio:  

1. **Custom Portfolio Website** – Built from scratch, incorporating modern web development best practices.  
2. **Learning Project** – Developed while learning HTML and CSS, based on structured tutorials and coursework.  

By working on these projects, I gained hands-on experience in responsive design, accessibility, and front-end development.
